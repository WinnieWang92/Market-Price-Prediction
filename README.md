# Market-Price-Prediction-Using-Unbiased-Learning-for-Censored-Data-in-Real-Time-Bidding
MSc Project

To run the code for this project, make sure you have Python 2.7 installed. The required dependencies are Numpy, SciPy, Matplotlib and Sklearn.

There are four folders in Code folderâ€“ pre-processing, statistics, winning-pro- estimation and market-price-prediction. Before running the code, follow steps in make-ipinyou-data (https://github.com/wnzhang/make-ipinyou-data) to convert original iPinYou data into feature vectors, and keep make-ipinyou-data folder in the same root with Code.

1. run simulated data.py in pre-processing first to simulating data for each campaign with new bidding strategy. Then run combine all.py to get data for all campaigns. After that, run get bo file.py to get a file with winning indicators (1 for win, 0 for lose) for each bid price in train set, and split test data.py to split test set into winning and losing subset.

2. run win lose ratio.py and visualization.py in statistics folder to get data statistics and the visualization of the market price distribution.

3. run biased.py and kaplan meier.py in winning-pro-estimation for winning probabilities with UOMP and KMMP setting respectively. Then run get trian wyzx bid.py to load true winning probability for each instance in train set, and run test full win prob.py get winning probabilities for FULL and TRUTH setting. Finally, run plot.py to plot line graphs of winning probabilities for each campaign.

4. run lin ll bias.py and lin ll unbias.py in market-price-prediction for routine (BIAS and FULL) and unbiased (UOMP and KMMP) training algorithm. Training log and weights of prediction model are written in files for tuning hyper- parameters. do prediction.py is for predicting market price, and rmse eval.py and plot rmse.py are for evaluation with RMSE and bar chart respectively.
